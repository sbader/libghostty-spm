## Usage

Start from the example apps:

- `Example/GhosttyTerminalApp/` — macOS AppKit demo with delegate callbacks
- `Example/MobileGhosttyApp/` — iOS UIKit demo with keyboard, safe area, themes, and text selection

### SwiftUI (iOS 15+ / macOS 13+ / Mac Catalyst 15+ / visionOS 1+)

```swift
import SwiftUI
import GhosttyTerminal

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var terminal = TerminalViewState()
    private let session = InMemoryTerminalSession(
        write: { data in
            // Handle bytes produced by the terminal.
        },
        resize: { viewport in
            // Keep your host backend in sync with the terminal grid.
        }
    )

    var body: some View {
        TerminalSurfaceView(context: terminal)
            .navigationTitle(terminal.title)
            .onAppear {
                terminal.configuration = TerminalSurfaceOptions(
                    backend: .inMemory(session)
                )
            }
    }
}
```

A host that keeps several surfaces mounted at once (tabs hidden behind
`opacity(0)`) sets `terminal.isSurfaceVisible = false` on the hidden ones.
The surface keeps its grid, scrollback, and session; only rendering stops.

### UIKit / AppKit

```swift
import GhosttyTerminal

let terminalView = TerminalView(frame: .zero)
terminalView.delegate = self
terminalView.controller = TerminalController(configFilePath: path)
terminalView.configuration = TerminalSurfaceOptions(
    backend: .inMemory(session)
)
```

`TerminalView` is a type alias that resolves to `UITerminalView` (iOS/Catalyst) or `AppTerminalView` (macOS).

### Keys and Pasted Text

`TerminalViewState` and `TerminalView` expose the same two input paths, and
they are not interchangeable:

```swift
terminal.sendKey(.enter)                         // Press and release a key.
terminal.sendKey(.c, modifiers: .ctrl)           // Ctrl+C.
terminal.sendKey(TerminalKeyPress(typing: "C")!) // c with Shift, from the US layout.
terminal.paste(text: "ls -la")                   // A paste, not keystrokes.
```

`sendKey(_:)` is the key path (also on `TerminalSurface`): `TerminalKey`
mirrors every libghostty key, the press is encoded the way the program's key
mode expects, and a release follows. `paste(text:)` is the text path: a
program that enabled bracketed paste receives it framed as a paste, so a `\r`
in it is a pasted character, not Enter. `paste(text:)` is the only name the
text path answers to on all three: 2.0.0 removed `TerminalViewState.send(_:)`,
`AppTerminalView.sendText(_:)` and the `TerminalSurface.sendText(_:)`
primitive, because none of them ever sent keystrokes and the names said
otherwise.

### Prompt and Scrollback Navigation

`TerminalViewState`, `TerminalView`, and `TerminalSurface` expose the same
programmatic navigation APIs:

```swift
terminal.jumpToPrompt(by: -1) // Previous prompt.
terminal.jumpToPrompt(by: 1)  // Next prompt.
terminal.scrollToRow(0)        // First absolute scrollback row.
```

Prompt navigation requires [shell integration](https://ghostty.org/docs/features/shell-integration),
which records prompt boundaries. The package bundles its own MIT-licensed
bash and zsh integration (OSC 133 prompt marks, OSC 7 working directory,
OSC 2 title, cursor shape) under `Resources/Ghostty/shell-integration`, and
the `.exec` backend injects it the way upstream Ghostty does; upstream's own
scripts are GPLv3 and are deliberately not shipped. Other shells get no
automatic integration. A host-managed backend must preserve or emit
equivalent OSC 133 prompt markers. Arbitrary Ghostty actions remain available
through `performBindingAction(_:)`.

### Pasting and Dropping Files

A paste reads the pasteboard the way Ghostty's macOS app does: URLs first —
a file URL as its shell-escaped path, any other URL verbatim — then the
string. A file copied in Finder or Files therefore pastes its path, never the
display name that sits beside it on the pasteboard. On iOS and Mac Catalyst,
image or document data with no path of its own (a screenshot, a photo, a file
copied out of Files) is written to a file first and the file's escaped path is
pasted.

Ghostty asks the host before a protected clipboard operation — a program
reading the clipboard through OSC 52, writing it when `clipboard-write = ask`,
or a paste that paste protection flagged — through
`TerminalViewState.onClipboardConfirmationRequest` (a delegate adopts
`TerminalSurfaceClipboardConfirmationDelegate`); the host presents the request
and answers `respond(allow:)`. While the hook is `nil`, a program's read or
write is denied silently and a paste the user started is allowed.

Dropping onto the terminal works the same way on iOS and Mac Catalyst: files
and images are copied into the staging directory and their escaped paths are
pasted; a dropped folder, link, or text pastes as text. Everything a drop
delivers travels the text path, like a paste — never as keystrokes.

Staged files live under `TerminalFileStaging.directory`, a `ghostty-paste`
folder in the app's temporary directory by default. A host whose shell cannot
read the app container points it somewhere both can reach before the first
paste or drop. Files stay until `TerminalFileStaging.staleFileAge` (24 hours)
has passed — swept whenever a new file is written, or on
`TerminalFileStaging.removeStaleFiles()`. A host calls
`TerminalFileStaging.removeAllFiles()` once no shell can reach the staged
files — its last shell ended, or the app is quitting together with its shells.

```swift
// A host that ends every shell when it quits.
func applicationWillTerminate(_: UIApplication) {
    endAllSessions()
    TerminalFileStaging.removeAllFiles()
}
```

### Surface Snapshots and Host View Subclasses

`TerminalView.snapshotImage()` renders the surface's current on-screen
contents into a `UIImage`/`NSImage`, and
`TerminalViewState.attachedPlatformView` hands the presenting view to hosts
that hold only the state. On UIKit the snapshot is a render-server pass
(`drawHierarchy`), so the Metal layer's presented frame is included; on AppKit
it is `cacheDisplay`, best-effort for Metal content.

Hosts that need their own view behavior — an interaction lock, custom hit
testing, a keyboard policy — set `TerminalViewState.makePlatformView` to
return a `TerminalView` subclass before the surface first appears; the
SwiftUI representable instantiates it instead of the base class. Policy
belongs in such a subclass, never in the byte stream: output keeps flowing
and rendering regardless. The overridable seams are everything UIKit/AppKit
give a view (`hitTest`, `canBecomeFirstResponder`) plus
`UITerminalView.toggleSoftwareKeyboard()`, which a clean tap calls after its
click has been sent — override it to keep a tap from raising or dismissing
the software keyboard.

On iOS, inline touch selection is on by default (`usesInlineTextSelection`;
Mac Catalyst uses pointer selection instead). A single tap first clears an active selection
or dismisses an open edit menu. Otherwise it sends the terminal click and
toggles the software keyboard, including in mouse-reporting applications.
Double/triple taps select a word/row and long press opens the edit menu;
those gestures do not also toggle the keyboard. Pinch zoom stays available.
Hosts should not add a second tap-to-focus handler around the terminal view.
Set `usesInlineTextSelection = false` to turn touch selection off; a tap then
only clicks and toggles the keyboard. The long-press viewport-snapshot sheet
(`TerminalTextSelectionRequest`, `TerminalSurfaceTextSelectionRequestDelegate`,
`TerminalViewState.onTextSelectionRequest`) has been removed.

## Notes

- `TerminalViewState` is the SwiftUI state container.
- `TerminalView` is the UIKit/AppKit view typealias.
- `TerminalController` owns app lifecycle, config resolution, themes, and surface creation.
- `InMemoryTerminalSession` provides the host-managed backend used by the sandboxed example apps.
- `GhosttyThemeCatalog` exposes bundled iTerm2 color schemes.

## Building from Source

The package downloads a pre-built XCFramework. To rebuild libghostty from the Ghostty source:

```bash
# Requires: zig (CI builds with 0.16.0 — the pinned upstream's minimum_zig_version)
./build.sh
./build.sh --platforms macos,ios --source /path/to/ghostty --skip-tests
```

`build.sh` forwards to `Script/build.sh`. Without `--source` it clones Ghostty
into `.build/local/ghostty-upstream`; `--ref` checks out a tag or commit there
(`Ghostty.ref` is the commit the shipped asset was built from). It applies the
patches in `Patches/ghostty/`, builds each platform group (`macos`, `ios`,
`maccatalyst`, `visionos` by default; macOS, Catalyst, and simulator slices
are arm64 and x86_64), assembles `BinaryTarget/GhosttyKit.xcframework` and
`.build/local/GhosttyKit.xcframework.zip`, and runs `Script/test.sh` and `swift test`
against the result unless `--skip-tests` is given. `Package.local.swift`
points the binary target at that local `BinaryTarget/` build; `--download-url`
regenerates `Package.swift` from `Package.swift.template` for an uploaded zip.

The `visionos` group builds against a patched copy of the Zig standard
library only when `Patches/zig/` holds a patch for the Zig on PATH (staged
under `.build/local/cache` by `Script/prepare-zig-lib.sh`; the toolchain itself is
never modified). Zig 0.16.0 needs none. Xcode 27 needs the Metal toolchain
component installed (`xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain`). An SDK
overlay script lived under `Script/support/` for Zig 0.15.2, which could not
link its build runner against that SDK; 0.16 does it unaided, so the script
was removed.

## Versions

Pin `1.5.2` or later (`from: "1.5.2"`). The `1.4.0` … `1.4.13` and `1.5.0`
tags and releases were withdrawn and no longer exist; `1.5.1` is the
oldest live tag on this track and the first with visionOS slices. Versions
since `2.2.2026100302` are `<major.minor>.<UTC YYYYMMDD><NN>`
(`2.2.2026100401`), where `NN` counts that day's releases from `01`;
from `1.5.2` through `2.2.20261003` the patch was the bare date
(`1.5.20260903`). In both, a
release lands every week with Ghostty pinned to upstream main's head of
that Monday (`Ghostty.ref`, a commit rather than a release, because
upstream tags rarely and main carries the fixes we need), the date leads the
patch number so a `from:` pin takes each one, and major.minor moves only
for a breaking change to this package's API. Package tags are cut by the
"Release Package" workflow only; `Script/audit-releases.sh` checks every
tag's manifest against the asset it downloads.

`upstream.<sha12>` releases carry the XCFramework built from that Ghostty
commit (`upstream.<sha12>-<N>` when the same commit was rebuilt with a
changed patch stack or target set — `Ghostty.build` holds `N`). The older
`upstream.1.3.1`, `upstream.1.3.1-2` (the first asset with visionOS slices)
and `upstream.1.3.1-3` were named after the upstream release instead; each
package tag's `Package.swift` downloads one of these. Those and the still
older `storage.*` tags are XCFramework assets, not package versions. SPM
should not depend on them.

## Trimmed Build
